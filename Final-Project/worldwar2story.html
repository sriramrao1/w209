                    <p><strong>1936 Olympics - Berlin, Germany</strong></p>
                    <p>In April 1933, an "Aryans only" policy was instituted in all German athletic organizations.For the first time in the history of the modern Olympic Games, United States and Europe called for a boycott of the Olympics because of the host country’s abuse of human rights. As a token gesture to placate international opinion, German authorities allowed the star fencer Helene Mayer to represent Germany at the Olympic Games in Berlin.</p> 
                    <p>The Nazi regime tried to camouflage its violent racist policies while it hosted the event. Most anti-Jewish signs were temporarily removed and newspapers toned down their harsh rhetoric to present foreign spectators and journalists with a false image of a peaceful, tolerant Germany.</p>
                    <p>Germany emerged victorious from the XIth Olympiad. German athletes captured the most medals, and German hospitality and organization won the praises of visitors. Some even found reason to hope that this peaceable interlude would endure. Only a few reporters, understood that the Berlin glitter was merely a facade hiding a racist and oppressively violent regime.
