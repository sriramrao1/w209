      <h2>World War II</h2>
      <p>World War II is considered to have officially started on Sept 1, 1939 with the german invasion of Poland. However, the effects of Nazi Fascism started with Hitler becoming the German Chancellor on Jan 30, 1933. In April 1933, Germany instituted a "Aryans-only" policy in all athletic organozations. Jewish athletes were barred from German sports clubs.</p>
        <p>1936 Summer Olympics - Berlin, Germany</p>
        <p>
            Nazi Germany used the 1936 Olympic Games for propaganda purposes. The Nazis promoted an image of a new, strong, and united Germany while masking the regime’s anti-semitic and racist policies as well as Germany’s growing militarism.

            For the first time in the history of the modern Olympic Games, people in the United States and Europe called for a boycott of the Olympics because of the host country’s abuse of human rights. Although the boycott movement ultimately failed, it set an important precedent for future campaigns to call world attention to contemporary human rights abuses in Olympic host countries.

            In April 1933, an "Aryans only" policy was instituted in all German athletic organizations. "Non-Aryans"—Jews or individuals with Jewish parents and Roma (Gypsies)—were systematically excluded from German sports facilities and associations.

            As a token gesture to placate international opinion, German authorities allowed the star fencer Helene Mayer to represent Germany at the Olympic Games in Berlin. Mayer was viewed as a “non-Aryan” because her father was Jewish.She won a silver medal in women's individual fencing and, like all other medalists for Germany, gave the Nazi salute on the podium. No other Jewish athlete competed for Germany in the Summer Games.

            In August 1936, the Nazi regime tried to camouflage its violent racist policies while it hosted the Summer Olympics. Most anti-Jewish signs were temporarily removed and newspapers toned down their harsh rhetoric, in line with directives from the Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels. Thus, the regime exploited the Olympic Games to present foreign spectators and journalists with a false image of a peaceful, tolerant Germany.

            Germany emerged victorious from the XIth Olympiad. German athletes captured the most medals, and German hospitality and organization won the praises of visitors. Most newspaper accounts echoed the New York Times report that the Games put Germans "back in the fold of nations," and even made them "more human again." Some even found reason to hope that this peaceable interlude would endure. Only a few reporters, such as the American William Shirer, understood that the Berlin glitter was merely a facade hiding a racist and oppressively violent regime.

        <p>1940 Summer Olympics - Tokyo, Japan</p>
        <p>Officially known as the Games of the XII Olympiad and originally scheduled to be held from 21 September to 6 October 1940, in Tokyo, Japan, were cancelled due to the outbreak of World War II.

            The IOC then awarded the Games to Helsinki, Finland, the city that had been the runner-up in the original bidding process. The Games were then scheduled to be staged from July 20 to August 4, 1940. 

            The Olympic Games were suspended indefinitely following the outbreak of World War II and did not resume until the London Games of 1948.
