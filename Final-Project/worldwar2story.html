      <h2>World War II</h2>
      <p>World War II is considered to have officially started on Sept 1, 1939 with the german invasion of Poland. However, the effects of Nazi Fascism started with Hitler becoming the German Chancellor on Jan 30, 1933. In April 1933, Germany instituted a "Aryans-only" policy in all athletic organozations. Jewish athletes were barred from German sports clubs.</p>
        <p>As a token gesture to placate international opinion, the Nazi regime temporarily removed anti-jewish signs, and toned down harsh anti-semitic rheoteric. The regime exploited the games to present foreign spectators and journalists with a false image of a peaceful and tolerant Germany. Germany won the most medals and won praises </p>
      <p>Due to World War 2 the 1940 (to be held in Tokyo) and 1944 (to be held in Helsinki) editions of the Olympics were cancelled</p>
      <p>Olympic events resumed in 1948 at London</p>
