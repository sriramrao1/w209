      <h2>Olympics during the Cold War</h2>
        <!--code--> 
        <div class="bodycontainer">The politicization of sport became a central theme for world powers following the end of the Second World War. The Olympics brought incredible media attention, required the host nation's financial support and built national reputations . These commercial aspects coupled with the egos of nations having recently gone to war with each other meant that the sporting competitions amongst them would offer a chance to demonstrate which country was superior.

        <!--p>1952 Summer Olympics – Helsinki, Finland</p>
        <p>The Soviet Union competes in its first Summer Olympic Games. At the start of the Soviet Union, all things that were seen as tools of capitalism were renounced; this included competitive sports.  Therefore, the Soviet Union refused to participate in the international Olympic Games.  However, by the 1930s the Soviet Union began to take a different stance concerning competitive sport.  The USSR saw the Olympics as a means to display Soviet power.  The Games provided an opportunity to show the dominance of the Soviet Union to the world, as well as to their own people.  Due to World War II, the Soviet Union did not join the Olympic Games until 1952
        Concerned that Cold War rivalries would lead to violence, East Bloc athletes are housed in a separate Olympic village from their western competitors.
        East Germany formed three years earlier in Soviet-occupied Germany, is denied its request to compete. Between 1956 and 1964, East and West Germany are required to pool their athletes and compete under the same banner.
        </p>

        <p><b>1956 Summer Olympics – Melbourne, Australia</b></p>
        <p>  
            The Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland also boycott the games in response to the Soviet invasion of Hungary.
            With tension between the Soviets and Hungarians high, fistfights erupt during a water polo match between the two nations. One player leaves the pool bloodied. The incident earns the nickname, “Blood in the Water.”
        </p>

        <p>1968 Summer Olympics – Mexico City, Mexico</p>
        <p>
        East Germany competes under its own banner for the first time and surpasses West Germany in medal count. This was repeated on ‘enemy’ territory at the 1972 Munich Games; subsequently, East Germany never fell below third in the rankings. 
        </p>

        <p>1972 Summer Olympics – Munich, Germany</p>
        <p>
        During a US – Soviet basketball match, confusion about whether a time-out had been called between free throws causes officials to add 3 seconds to the end of the game. The US leads by a point, but the added time allows Soviet Alexander Belov to catch a cross-court pass and drain the winning lay-up. The upset by Soviet Union was viewed as a great feat inside Soviet Union.
        East Germany becomes an elite sporting nation, collecting 66 medals – only the Soviets and the Americans win more at 99 and 94 respectively – putting East Germany ahead of host nation and bitter rival, West Germany.
        </p>

        <p>1980 Moscow Olympics</p>
        <p> 
        Following the USSR’s invasion of Afghanistan, Jimmy Carter, the President of the United States, ordered the US to boycott the Olympic games held in Moscow.  United States, along with 64 of its allies – including Canada – do not attend the games. It is the largest boycott in Olympic history. The Soviet Union was devastated by the small turnout for the prestigious games. 
        </p>

        <p>1984 Los Angeles Olympics</p>
        <p> 
        Claiming that its athletes will not be safe from protests and possible physical attacks, the Soviet Union announces that it will not compete in the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles. Despite the Soviet statement, it was obvious that the boycott was a response to the decision of the United States to boycott the 1980 games that were held in Moscow.
        In the days following the Soviet announcement, 13 other communist nations issued similar statements and refused to attend the games. Without competition from the Soviet Union, East Germany, and other communist nations, the United States swept to an Olympic record of 83 gold medals.
        </p>

        <p>1988 Summer Olympics – Seoul, South Korea</p>
        <p>
        After South Korea denies North Korea’s bid to be a joint Olympic host, the North withdraws its athletes from all competitions.
