            <h2>The Rise of China</h2>
        <!--code--> 
            <div class="htext">China was admitted in to the IOC in 1979. China boycotted the 1980 Olympics over Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan. China first participated in the Summer Olympics in 1984. Since then, China has been a rising Olympic power starting with 76 medals in 1984 to 184 medals in 2008 at the Beijing Olympics. With that tally, China ranked second in the overall medal count, topping traditional Olympic super powers such as Russia, Germany and Great Britain.

                    <p>The Soviet Union competes in its first Summer Olympic Games. In the early 1900s Soviet Union renounced all events that were seen as tools of capitalism - this included competitive sports.  Therefore, the Soviet Union refused to participate in the international Olympic Games.  However, by the 1930s the Soviet Union began to see the Olympics as an opportunity to show the dominance of the Soviet Union to the world, as well as to their own people.  Due to World War II, the Soviet Union did not join the Olympic Games until 1952.</p>

                     <p>The Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland boycott the games in response to the Soviet invasion of Hungary.
                        With tension between the Soviets and Hungarians high, fistfights erupt during a water polo match between the two nations. One player leaves the pool bloodied. The incident earns the nickname, “Blood in the Water.”
